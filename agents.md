# Agent Guidelines

## Discussion Before Implementation

When working on this codebase, the agent should:

1. **Discuss design decisions before implementing** - Don't start coding a solution without first explaining the approach and getting feedback. This is especially important for:
   - Architectural changes
   - New environment variables or configuration options
   - Changes to how components interact

2. **Avoid premature conclusions** - Phrases like "the issue is clear now" often indicate assumptions that need verification. Take time to understand the problem fully.

3. **Work incrementally** - Make small changes, test them, discuss results. Don't batch up large changes.

4. **Show understanding first** - When debugging, explain what we know and what the possibilities are before diving into fixes.
