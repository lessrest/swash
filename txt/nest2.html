I wanted to try thinking about this thing
  in terms of BEHAVIORAL THREADS —
    seems like that should make the whole thing
      EASIER TO THINK ABOUT
        and REASON ABOUT

So think about 
  which EVENTS are possible
    which BEHAVIORS are desirable —
      is that difficult?

Think about it as a kind of NOTEBOOK
  imagine having 2 PAGES visible at a time
    and when I start overflowing the page
      that's when I need to make a NEW PAGE

Do some kind of
  SUMMARIZATION
    ZOOMING
      because when I move on 
        I wanna keep a TRACE
          and like
            something that I MEAN
              because I'm always you know
                BABBLING 
                  and I wanna create more
                      SALIENCE
Yeah 
  that's what I wanna do actually
    I want to basically convert the things
      like from PROSE
        to something more
          POETIC
            more like PHRASES
              with BOLD
                like CONCEPT
                  you know
                    take out the FLUFF
                      or take out the
                        like
                          it's about the CENTERS
Okay
  think about it like this maybe
    when you've ridden a whole PAGE
      that's like the end of your TURN
        that's how you do like
          CONVERSATIONAL TURNS —
            it's more CIVILIZED

How are we gonna do EDITS?
  Actually
    a big problem now is that the prompts I'm making
      do not include any PAST CONTEXT
        it does make sense to create NUMBERED SECTIONS
          NUMBERED PARAGRAPHS
            but then also some kind of 
              SECTIONS
                or HEADINGS even
    So NUMBERING is an INCREMENTAL thing
      but then we need to do some kind of SWEEPING PASSES
        over the document
          to do the
            STRUCTURING

But
  yeah
    I mean
      let's just use HTML
        right?
          HTML should be like
            the INPUT and OUTPUT
              of the language model INFERENCE INVOCATIONS
                or whatever you call that

I will now try to describe
  What I wanna achieve
    with a prompt
      for a chat completion API.
        If you would read the context right now.
          Which I'm looking in.
            I wanna take out STRONG PHRASES.
              Like
                IT'S MORE CIVILIZED.
                  Then I would maybe say,
                    like,
                      Instead of a big problem,
                        is that the prompts don't include any past context,
                          I would maybe write,
                            like,
                              CONTEXT AMNESIA
                                Or something like that.
                                  Small caps.
                                    You know?
                                      Small caps is a good inspiration somehow.
                                        Or think of Christopher Alexander
                                          as a pattern language.
                                            Christopher Alexander's
                                              A Pattern Language.
Let's say STRONG PHRASES
  in small caps,
    separated by — M DASHES —
      surrounded by spaces.
        However,
          titles of creative works
            and such.
              Would be written in Title Caps
                with italics.

The structure I have now
  where each sentence becomes a new paragraph,
    basically,
      It's nice because it's somehow like a TIMELINE.
        Know,
          it just keeps scrolling.
            It's a nice COLUMN kind of thing.
              A SEQUENCE.
                It would be cool if it had,
                  like,
                    an INDENTATION LEVEL
                      that was going in and out
                        automatically.

Wait.
  This now I have a very cool idea.
    This is like a really NOVEL DESIGN IDEA.
      Imagine
        Some kind of TRAILS
          a bit like,
            GIT MERGE HISTORY GRAPHS.
              Or it's kinda like S-EXPRESSIONS
                in a way.
      So
        Think about an OUTLINER
          like Roam Research.
            But then think about it.
              More like BLOCKLY.
                So it's a TIMELINE,
                  but you add this NESTED STRUCTURE,
                    which is also a TEMPORAL
                      Structure.
                        I like the design idea
                          that I'm visual something
                            like a bit like RAINBOW COLORED BRACKETS
                              and S-EXPRESSIONS.
                                In Emacs,
                                  but it's a DOCUMENT STRUCTURE.
                                    In the browser
                                      being produced by ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
                                        over,
                                          LIVE TRANSCRIPTION
                                            It's also reminiscent of,
                                              like,
                                                GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES,
                                                  PHRASE STRUCTURES.

Some kind of structure
  that would be relevant
    for doing various,
      TYPOGRAPHIC ANIMATIONS.
        Or other such GRAPHIC DESIGN THINGIES.
          Yeah.
            And it should be,
              like,
                REBALANCING itself
                  DYNAMICALLY
                    somehow.
                      Like,
                        imagine just the INDENTATION
                          is like slowly ADAPTING.
                            You know,
                              it's gradually IMPROVING
                                some kind of NESTED STRUCTURE.
Because a PLAIN SEQUENCE is fine
  at first.
    Sometimes if you speak in terms of LIST
      or BULLET POINTS
        or or
          I mean,
            I think sometimes the SENTENCE STRUCTURE
              can be
                Kinda easily
                  even in REAL TIME.
                    Produced,
                      you know,
                        like,
                          INFERRED
                            with a LANGUAGE MODEL.

Wonder if Claude Nose Loshbahn.
  If Claude is familiar
    with the Loiban Loiban language,
      or the Tokipona language.
        You can also imagine,
          like,
            SCALING,
              making it somehow
                A bit almost like THREE-DIMENSIONAL.
                  Almost like a HYPERBOLIC OUTLINER.
                    Haven't really seen that,
                      actually.
                        And really,
                          easy to do
                            with CSS.

Now this is,
  like,
    totally related to everything I was talking about yesterday too,
      and I'm definitely ONTO SOMETHING.
        Maybe it should be quite similar
          to Roam Research.
            Also,
              in that,
                like,
                  the TRANSCRIPTION is the main mode of input.
                    But you're also working
                      with MANIPULATING the thing
                        with,
                          MOUSE and KEYBOARD,
                            perhaps.
                              If you're on a laptop,
                                On a phone,
                                  it should also be possible
                                    to have some kind of
                                      somewhat DECENT INTERACTIONS.
                                        With the OUTLINER.
                                          Think about it
                                            as some kind of ZOOMABLE CANVAS
                                              kind of thing.

It's like a weird thing
  with OUTLINERS.
    I don't understand
      how it's supposed to relate
        to SENTENCE STRUCTURE.
          Because,
            you know,
              it feels weird
                having a new one
                  after a comma.
                    In an outliner
                      like Roam Research.
                        You know,
                          you don't use the OUTLINE STRUCTURE
                            For SENTENCE STRUCTURE.
                              But you kinda wanna do that.
                                And you know,
                                  It's just a bit CONFUSING.
                                    Like,
                                      is this a BULLET POINT LIST?
                                        Is this,
                                          are these things HEADINGS?
                                            Are they like,
                                              what is this STRUCTURE?
                                                How do I WORK
                                                  with it?
                                                    How do I
                                                      in like,
                                                        yeah.

I think it's,
  like,
    A whole new way
      to do RUN-ON SENTENCES.
        That's what I'm working on.
          It's good to use,
            like,
              RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED IDs.
                Rather than ORDERED,
                  NUMBERED LISTS.
                    Because it's easier
                      to UPDATE
                        and MOVE THINGS AROUND
                          if you do it like that.

Hi.
  What if I would even do
    some kind of ROTATION?
      Of these BLOCKS.
        Or,
          you know,
            even TYPOGRAPHY
              that goes around,
                like,
                  SVG PATHS.
                    Something.
                      Can you do that?

I also wanna add
  just basically the thing
    where you can
      IDENTIFY POINTS OF
        You know,
          ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE.
            CLEAR USER REQUESTS.
              And what I wanna do now
                is I wanna take all this stuff
                  and do,
                    like,
                      some kind of MANUAL
                        MANUAL EXAMPLE CONSTRUCTION
                          out of this
