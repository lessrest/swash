Behavioral programming is a paradigm based on an event-driven model of
computation.

Definition: An **event** is a discrete occurrence that can be generated by the
system's modules, the user, or the environment.

Proposition: The execution of a behaviorally programmed system can be viewed
as a sequence of events.

Definition: A **behavior thread** (or **b-thread** for short) is a module that
represents a behavior, scenario, or plan.

Hint: B-threads can be thought of as programs running in parallel or as rules
continuously governing the system's execution.

Proposition: B-threads should ideally communicate only through events,
remaining independent and oblivious to each other's internal state.

Definition: **Implicit permission seeking** means that a b-thread generates
events in a way that allows other b-threads to forbid or override them.

Proposition: The behavioral programming infrastructure automatically
synchronizes b-threads, giving them the opportunity to interact with each
other's events.

Definition: **Requesting** an event means that a b-thread proposes the event
for consideration in the execution, prepared for the possibility that it may
not be triggered immediately or at all.

Hint: B-threads can request alternative events to progress even if some are
blocked by other b-threads.

Definition: **Blocking** is the ability of a b-thread to forbid events
requested by other b-threads.

Proposition: Only events that are requested and not blocked can be triggered,
based on a global view of the system.

Definition: **Listening** allows b-threads to react to events they did not
request, adapting their behavior accordingly.

Proposition: B-threads can progress past synchronization points when events
they requested or waited for are triggered.

Definition: **Unification** ensures that when multiple b-threads request the
same event, they are all notified and progress independently when it is
triggered.

Proposition: B-threads are orthogonal to objects, able to represent individual
objects or inter-object scenarios.

Hint: B-threads can interact with the environment, translating between
external occurrences and behavioral events.
