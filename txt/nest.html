  <p>
    I wanted to try thinking about this thing in terms of behavioral threads.
  </p>
  <p>
    It seems like that should make a lot of sense, and it seems like it should
    make the whole thing easier to think about.
  </p>
  <p>Easier to reason about.</p>
  <p>Know, All done.</p>
  <p>All that.</p>
  <p>So how do I think about it?</p>
  <p>
    I guess, you know, it's just about thinking about which events are
    possible or which behaviors are, you know, which behaviors link up the
    system Is it default or what?
  </p>
  <p>Which behaviors make up the system?</p>
  <p>Is that difficult or what?</p>
  <p>I just had a nice idea, actually.</p>
  <p>Here's what I would like to do.</p>
  <p>
    I would like to think about it as a kind of notebook and I imagine having
    2 pages visible at a time.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I also imagine it's like, when I It's like I wanna write 1 page And
    then like, once I start overflowing the page, That's when I need to make a
    new page.
  </p>
  <p>Right?</p>
  <p>
    But that's also an opportunity to do some kind of summarization or
    zooming.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, I was thinking of something like when I run out of the page, that's
    when I wanna condense it.
  </p>
  <p>Create symbols or create an image, condense it somehow.</p>
  <p>
    Because when I move on, I wanna keep a trace And, like, Something that I
    mean, because I'm always, you know, babbling and I wanna create more sail
    Salience.
  </p>
  <p>Yeah.</p>
  <p>That's what I wanna do, actually.</p>
  <p>
    I want to basically convert the things like from pros to something More,
    poetic.
  </p>
  <p>More like Phrases.</p>
  <p>
    With Bold Like, concept You know, take out the fluff or take out the Like,
    it's about the centers.
  </p>
  <p>Okay.</p>
  <p>Think about it like this maybe.</p>
  <p>When you've ridden a whole page, that's like the end of your turn.</p>
  <p>That's how you do, like, conversational turns.</p>
  <p>It's more civilized.</p>
  <p>How are we gonna do edits?</p>
  <p>
    Actually, a big problem now is that the prompts I'm making do not include
    any past context.
  </p>
  <p>It does make sense to create numbered Sections.</p>
  <p>
    Numbered paragraphs but then also some kind of Sections or headings even.
  </p>
  <p>So numbering is an incremental thing.</p>
  <p>
    But then we need to do some kind of sweeping passes over the document To
    do the, Structuring.
  </p>
  <p>But, yeah, I mean, let's just use HTML.</p>
  <p>Right?</p>
  <p>
    HTML should be like, the input and output of the language model inference.
  </p>
  <p>Invocations, or whatever you call that.</p>
  <p>
    I will now try to describe What I wanna achieve with a prompt for a chat
    completion API.
  </p>
  <p>If you would read the context right now.</p>
  <p>Which I'm looking in.</p>
  <p>I wanna take out strong phrases.</p>
  <p>Like It's more civilized.</p>
  <p>
    Then I would maybe say, like, Instead of a big problem, is that the
    prompts don't include any past context, I would maybe write, like, context
    amnesia in all caps.
  </p>
  <p>Or something like that.</p>
  <p>Small caps.</p>
  <p>You know?</p>
  <p>Small caps is a good inspiration somehow.</p>
  <p>Or think of Christopher Alexander as a pattern language.</p>
  <p>Christopher Alexander's A Better Language Book.</p>
  <p>A pattern in language.</p>
  <p>
    Let's say strong phrases in small caps, separated by m dashes surrounded
    by spaces.
  </p>
  <p>However, titles of creative works and such.</p>
  <p>Would be written in title caps with italics.</p>
  <p>
    The structure I have now where each sentence becomes a new paragraph,
    basically, It's nice because it's somehow like a timeline.
  </p>
  <p>Know, it just keeps scrolling.</p>
  <p>It's a nice column kind of thing.</p>
  <p>A sequence.</p>
  <p>
    It would be cool if it had, like, an indentation level that was going in
    and out automatically.
  </p>
  <p>Wait.</p>
  <p>This now I have a very cool idea.</p>
  <p>This is like a really novel design idea.</p>
  <p>Imagine Some kind of trails a bit like, git merge history graphs.</p>
  <p>Or it's kinda like s expressions in a way.</p>
  <p>So Think about an outliner like Roam Research.</p>
  <p>But then think about it.</p>
  <p>More like blockly.</p>
  <p>
    So it's a timeline, but you add this nested structure, which is also a
    temporal Structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like the design idea that I'm visual something like a bit like rainbow
    colored brackets and s expressions.
  </p>
  <p>In emacs, but it's a document structure.</p>
  <p>
    In the browser being produced by artificial intelligence over, live
    transcription It's also reminiscent of, like, grammatical structures,
    phrase structures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some kind of structure that would be relevant for doing various,
    typographic animations.
  </p>
  <p>Or other such graphic design thingies.</p>
  <p>Yeah.</p>
  <p>And it should be, like, rebalancing itself dynamically somehow.</p>
  <p>Like, imagine just the indentation is like slowly adapting.</p>
  <p>You know, it's gradually improving some kind of nested structure.</p>
  <p>Because a plain sequence is fine at first.</p>
  <p>
    Sometimes if you speak in terms of list or bullet points or or I mean, I
    think sometimes the sentence structure can be Kinda easily even in real
    time.
  </p>
  <p>Produced, you know, like, inferred with a language model.</p>
  <p>Wonder if Claude Nose Loshbahn.</p>
  <p>
    If Claude is familiar with the Loiban Loiban language, or the tokipona
    language.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also imagine, like, scaling, making it somehow A bit almost like
    three-dimensional.
  </p>
  <p>Almost like a hyperbolic outliner.</p>
  <p>Haven't really seen that, actually.</p>
  <p>And really, easy to do with CSS.</p>
  <p>
    Now this is, like, totally related to everything I was talking about
    yesterday too, and I'm definitely onto something.
  </p>
  <p>Maybe it should be quite similar to Roam Research.</p>
  <p>Also, in that, like, the transcription is the main mode of input.</p>
  <p>
    But you're also working with manipulating the thing with, mouse and
    keyboard, perhaps.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're on a laptop, On a phone, it should also be possible to have some
    kind of somewhat decent interactions.
  </p>
  <p>With the outliner.</p>
  <p>Think about it as some kind of zoomable canvas kind of thing.</p>
  <p>It's like a weird thing with outliners.</p>
  <p>I don't understand how it's supposed to relate to sentence structure.</p>
  <p>Because, you know, it feels weird having a new one after a comma.</p>
  <p>In an outliner like Roam Research.</p>
  <p>You know, you don't use the outline structure For sentence structure.</p>
  <p>But you kinda wanna do that.</p>
  <p>And you know, It's just a bit confusing.</p>
  <p>Like, is this a bullet point list?</p>
  <p>Is this, are these things headings?</p>
  <p>Are they like, what is this structure?</p>
  <p>How do I work with it?</p>
  <p>How do I in like, yeah.</p>
  <p>I think it's, like, And whole new way to do run on sentences.</p>
  <p>That's what I'm working on.</p>
  <p>It's good to use, like, randomly distributed IDs.</p>
  <p>Rather than ordered, numbered lists.</p>
  <p>
    Because it's easier to update and move things around if you do it like
    that.
  </p>
  <p>Hi.</p>
  <p>What if I would even do some kind of rotation?</p>
  <p>Of these blocks.</p>
  <p>Or, you know, even typography that goes around, like, SVG paths.</p>
  <p>Something.</p>
  <p>Can you do that?</p>
  <p>
    I also wanna add just basically the thing where you can Identify Points of
    You know, Asking for assistance.
  </p>
  <p>Clear user requests.</p>
  <p>
    And what I wanna do now is I wanna take all this stuff and do, like, some
    kind of manual manual example construction out of this
  </p>
