// This is a live transcription web app. 
// It listens to the mic, transcribes what's said in real-time.
// User's words show up on the screen. Like magic.
// Basic functionality for now. Nothing fancy.
// Implemented with structured concurrency. Whatever that means.
// Sometimes I wonder if anyone really listens anymore.
// Or if it's all just words, floating away into the void.
