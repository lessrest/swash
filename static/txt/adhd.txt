### Highlights

- ADHD doesn’t just affect the practical matters of life, such as loading the dishwasher and remembering to call the bank. It also affects the emotional aspects, such as trust, closeness, connection, and empathy. In other words, all the same challenges that every relationship needs to deal with.
- What the ADHD does is increase the frequency or intensity of the same practical and emotional struggles that the neighbors are also wrestling with—fairness in the division of labor and feeling like the relationship brings out the best in each of the partners.
- Creating a happy and enduring relationship is no easy task, but it can feel almost impossible when the couple doesn’t know about ADHD—and when I say that they don’t know about it, what I mean is that they don’t have ADHD as the explanation for it. They will both know very, very well all the ways that ADHD is affecting their lives. But before the word ADHD comes up on their radar screens, they will use other explanations which may begin as neutral or vaguely positive, such as, “he’s just a free spirit,” but will rather quickly degenerate into decidedly more negative interpretations, such as, “he’s only interested in his things.”
- The diagnosis of ADHD can also have a tremendous emotional impact for both partners, by changing the perception of the problematic ADHD behaviors as being less a matter of choice (and therefore a reflection of character) and more as a reflection of certain abilities.
- No discussion of emotions in ADHD-impacted relationships would be complete without pointing out that there are inherent tensions between the very qualities that define one as having ADHD and the qualities that comprise strong relationships.
- Some of these emotional struggles have to do with how long it takes to get ADHD symptomatic behaviors under control. It’s hard for non-ADHD partners to understand this process because the experience of having ADHD is so foreign. Like those with ADHD, non-ADHD partners are sometimes distracted, inconsistent, late, forgetful, poor planners and more. However, their view of what it’s like to have these characteristics is skewed by the temporary nature of the issues for them.
- Non-ADHD partners end up feeling they need to be constantly on alert so their lives don’t spiral out of control. ADHD partners, who have learned to live with the impact of ADHD symptoms, are often oblivious to the very real emotional problems and stress their symptoms encourage in their partners.
- In an intentional relationship, both partners think very carefully about their choices and responses. They focus on today and building a tomorrow rather than rehashing past difficulties. They learn all they can about ADHD, its treatment, and how to respond to it. They experiment singly and together. When things don’t work as planned, they consider it a learning experience rather than a failure, and experiment again—this time honing their efforts a bit.
- As this journey unfolds, it is typical that non-ADHD partners suffer from anxieties and pose questions related to the repetitive nature of entrenched ADHD symptoms. For example, while observing their partner’s slow progress at managing ADHD symptoms, they might wonder, Is my partner really dedicated to this? If so, why isn’t he working harder to address his ADHD? As understandable as these feelings and uncertainties are, they miss the larger point. People with ADHD have trouble getting organized and following through. That’s part of having ADHD.
- First, “attention deficit hyperactivity disorder” is misnamed. ADHD isn’t about a deficit of attention—it’s about attention dysregulation. A person with ADHD can be very distractible much of the time but also have periods of intense focus, sometimes called hyperfocus. The “deficit” is really a deficit of control, or regulation, over one’s attention. Just because a person with ADHD wants to pay attention to something doesn’t mean he or she will be able to do so at that moment. ADHD treatment is all about putting strategies in place to help the person with ADHD have more control over his or her attention, emotional regulation, memory and behaviors.
- The ability to carry an intention or thought forward in time so you may act on it.
- Stimulants can increase irritability or anger. If this happens to you, try a different dose or different medication. Anger and irritability are not good side effects in a relationship!
- Simplifying and organizing boring tasks comes more easily to non-ADHD partners because the reminder and reward system is there—invisibly—on the inside of their heads. For those with ADHD, that internal system is not there—by definition. That’s the “executive function problems” description of ADHD. This means you must add external structures that non-ADHD partners don’t use.
- ADHD coaches can be a big help with Leg 2 treatments. A good ADHD coach can point you towards possible solutions that have worked for others with ADHD, shortening the time it takes to find the right ideas for you. He or she can also provide temporary external structures (reminders, charts and the like) to help you create new habits.
- As each of you ponders what external structures to use, utilize your strengths. If you are a visual person, notes and whiteboards might work well. If you are an audible learner, perhaps using a voice recorder to capture information and setting audible alarms will help. If you like to write, journaling to work out your feelings could be effective. Further, think about structuring your life and tasks around things you do well. Some of us spent a lot of time in school remediating our weaknesses. But as an adult you don’t have any paper exams to complete. Once you get past a very basic level of competence, it’s much more effective to strengthen your strengths.
- As part of a couple, you don’t have to do everything well. Steve is the computer whiz in the Kohlenberger household. Anything computers is his bailiwick. Nancie finds joy in planning social activities with their friends. He leaves those “responsibilities” to her.
- Everybody has skills and talents. As you search for these, think broadly. Think about qualities such as empathy, creativity, energy, organization and more. An empathetic and energetic partner might make a great caregiver for children, for example, even if he isn’t very organized. Remember to play to your strengths as often as possible and to support your partner in doing the same. This will help you both shine!
- The ADHD brain is somewhat “unfiltered.” Everything enters at about the same level. This means that lots of information is vying for attention, and it’s very hard to differentiate and organize. (On the positive side, an abundance of information can nourish creativity.) Conversely, non-ADHD partners may have hierarchical brains that filter out even more than they realize.
- People with ADHD tend to live in the moment. They tend to “go with the flow” and react to their environment. Those without ADHD spend a good amount of time anticipating what will happen next, planning for the future and ruminating about the past. They may more proactively “make things happen.”
- Those with ADHD often get from point A to point B in a non-linear fashion. This contrasts with many non-ADHD partners, who pride themselves on their efficiency.
- Many with ADHD have difficulty managing time, controlling impulses, and planning. Such tasks are often strengths for non-ADHD partners.
- Over time, and with repeated failures, people with undiagnosed ADHD often come to question themselves. The resulting low self-esteem can easily impact decision-making and communication. The thought that I’ll probably fail anyway, so why should I try? becomes a coping strategy that is hard for a non-ADHD partner to understand.
- Though it’s not politically correct to say this, we will. Men and women often approach things differently and this impacts your relationship. Two gender-specific communication issues seem to come up over and over again in our couples counseling: Many women find the act of talking things out therapeutic. They like to talk about their feelings and what these feelings mean to them. This is in direct conflict with men, who often seek to fix things and move on. Extended talking can seem beside the point. On average it is physiologically harder for a man to be in conflict with a loved one. Research shows that both men and women respond to conflict physiologically with elevated stress chemicals, higher heart rates and faster breathing. Women, however, have the advantage of being faster self-soothers after conflict than men
- And women, if you want to discuss a potentially conflict-laden topic with a male partner, creating a low/no conflict environment will increase the chances that your partner will willingly participate.
- You, the ADHD partner, might love your partner more than the moon and the stars put together. You might feel all mushy inside when she walks in. You might feel as if your world would completely fall apart if your partner left you. But trust us when we tell you that what your undermanaged symptomatic behaviors communicate is that you don’t care.
- When your non-ADHD partner comes to you and says she feels lonely or that he feels you don’t love him enough or that your lack of involvement in the day-to-day parts of the relationship hurts, BELIEVE it! Your partner isn’t questioning your love to put on a show.
- Lack of attention hurts. A lot. In fact, we think it is the number one villain in ADHD-impacted relationships.
- Though not the issue for the couple above, sometimes ADHD partners avoid interacting with their partner because they fear that “attending” will not be fun, often with good reason. When a relationship is struggling, many of the interactions with non-ADHD partners are painful, angry or shame-inducing. Why would you want to spend a lot of time talking to your partner when doing so brings on a slew of lectures about how miserable you are or how bad a spouse you have become?
- ADHD partner: I feel ADHD has helped me a great deal, particularly at work. As an ADHD partner, I am usually obsessed with one thing or another that draws my attention away from my partner. How does one communicate caring while so much attention is devoted elsewhere?
- On the ADHD partner’s side, attention from non-ADHD partners has frequently been negative in nature. “More attention” may have an ominous ring to it, and the ADHD partner may similarly fear that the positive attention will last for a while but then turn into criticism or disappointment.
- Attend anyway. Jump into paying more positive attention even if you feel these worries. Though you will not be 100% perfect in your efforts, attending will improve your daily interactions.
- Schedule regular blocks of time to be together. You can figure out what you are doing during that time later.
- Create regular “little routines” that say I love you and want to be with you to your partner.
- Say “I love you” at least once every day.
- Couples who are having trouble feeling intimately connected can benefit from creating 10-15 minutes of non-sexual cuddle time at night or in the morning.
- This is time to feel the connection of touch, say nice things to each other, or just experience the joy of being near your partner without any pressure. It’s a very positive way to start or finish your day.
- Create a 5-minute no complaints rule. When you walk in the door after a hard day, spend five minutes in the same room talking about positive things that happened that day. This makes the transition back home easier while also reinforcing a positive tone to your relationship.
- Create reset weekends. This is harder when there are kids around, though friends or grandparents can babysit. The idea is to get away from it all by immersing yourselves in each other for 48 hours.
- We alluded to the idea that reliability is a critical factor in building a strong relationship—and that ADHD symptoms definitely interfere with reliability! It’s safe to say that from a relationship perspective, the whole point of treating ADHD is to make sure that the ADHD partner is reliable enough in the relationship.
- A common non-ADHD/ADHD difference, for example, has to do with what constitutes “adequately organized” as relates to planning events, organizing a household, raising children and the like. Another is whether or not you should let things “just happen” (be spontaneous) or whether you should actively “make them happen” (plan ahead and pursue set goals).
- Like many with ADHD, Steve is a late night person who often comes to bed after 1 a.m. This used to drive Nancie crazy. For the longest time, Nancie tried to impress upon Steve how important it was that they be in bed at the same time. Many uncomfortable conversations led to Steve feeling controlled and Nancie feeling hurt and baffled by his late night habits. Now, Steve gets into bed a couple of nights a week at the same time as Nancie, and they almost daily spend some time together in the mornings when they awaken. This gives them together time, which is what Nancie wanted, while respecting Steve’s desires, too. Nancie has learned to enjoy her quiet reading time before lights out on the nights when Steve stays up later, so she has turned a negative into a positive.
- It was easy for George to become distracted by—and engaged with—things more interesting than changing the latest dirty diaper, going to the grocery store for more milk, or calling animal control to get the raccoons out from under the porch. Disengaging from the home office computer was hard enough because of his ADHD. Trying to do so to fold and put away the laundry when his wife was also capable of doing it seemed almost impossible. He simply could not muster the motivation.
- Adding kids to your lives is a huge stressor and contributor to the chore wars. Before children, non-ADHD partners may have compensated successfully (and without too much resentment) for ADHD disorganization. We’re not saying this compensating behavior was a good thing, only that this is what probably happened. Then came kids. Children not only add financial stress to many relationships but also put the need for better organization at home on steroids. There is simply a greater volume of work that needs to be done, and lots of it is not very interesting. Plus, the work is 24/7, and safety issues become more pressing when you are responsible for children. As if all of this weren’t enough, you are both getting less sleep—increasing the presence of ADHD symptoms just as you need a greater ability to focus.
