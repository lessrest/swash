Here is a summary of the key points from The Couple's Guide to Thriving With ADHD, along with some suggested conversation starters for a couple discussing ADHD and its impact on their relationship:

ADHD affects both the practical and emotional aspects of relationships. It can increase the frequency and intensity of common relationship struggles. Getting an ADHD diagnosis helps reframe problematic behaviors as ability-related rather than character flaws.

"No discussion of emotions in ADHD-impacted relationships would be complete without pointing out that there are inherent tensions between the very qualities that define one as having ADHD and the qualities that comprise strong relationships."

Conversation prompt: Each partner shares how they feel ADHD has impacted the relationship, both practically and emotionally. Listen without judgment.

ADHD partners often underestimate the stress and emotional toll their symptoms have on their partners. Non-ADHD partners can feel they constantly need to be "on alert." Patience is key as ADHD treatment is an ongoing process.

"Non-ADHD partners end up feeling they need to be constantly on alert so their lives don't spiral out of control. ADHD partners, who have learned to live with the impact of ADHD symptoms, are often oblivious to the very real emotional problems and stress their symptoms encourage in their partners."

Prompt: The non-ADHD partner shares how the ADHD symptoms make them feel. The ADHD partner reflects back what they hear. Switch roles.

ADHD is an issue with attention regulation and executive functioning. External reminders, simplifying tasks, working with a coach, and playing to your strengths can help manage symptoms. Gender differences in communication styles are also a factor to consider.

"The ADHD brain is somewhat 'unfiltered.' Everything enters at about the same level. This means that lots of information is vying for attention, and it's very hard to differentiate and organize. Conversely, non-ADHD partners may have hierarchical brains that filter out even more than they realize."

Prompt: Brainstorm strategies to simplify routines and leverage each partner's strengths. Discuss communication preferences.

Lack of attention is very hurtful to the non-ADHD partner. The ADHD partner needs to make an effort to attend to their partner, even if past interactions have been negative. Scheduling quality time, expressing love daily, and having complaint-free check-ins help rebuild connection.

"Lack of attention hurts. A lot. In fact, we think it is the number one villain in ADHD-impacted relationships...ADHD partner: I feel ADHD has helped me a great deal, particularly at work. As an ADHD partner, I am usually obsessed with one thing or another that draws my attention away from my partner. How does one communicate caring while so much attention is devoted elsewhere?"

Prompt: Each share one thing your partner does that makes you feel loved and attended to. Commit to one new habit to show love and attention.

The ultimate goal of ADHD treatment in a relationship is increasing the reliability of the ADHD partner. Couples also need to negotiate differing standards for things like organization and planning vs. spontaneity. Adding kids dramatically increases the need for reliable co-parenting.

"We alluded to the idea that reliability is a critical factor in building a strong relationshipâ€”and that ADHD symptoms definitely interfere with reliability! It's safe to say that from a relationship perspective, the whole point of treating ADHD is to make sure that the ADHD partner is reliable enough in the relationship."

Prompt: Discuss expectations around reliability, organization and planning. Where can you compromise? How will you navigate co-parenting duties?

The key is approaching these conversations with empathy, an open mind, and a collaborative spirit. It's you two against the ADHD, not against each other. Allow space for both partners to share without interrupting or getting defensive. Focus on understanding each other's perspectives and finding solutions that work for both of you.
