// Package file provides a future portable EventLog implementation.
//
// Intended direction:
// - Store and query structured swash events without relying on journald/sdjournal.
// - Keep the EventLog interface stable so callers can swap implementations.
//
// This package is a placeholder; implementation is intentionally deferred.
